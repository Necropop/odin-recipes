        <p>Meet the Fuzzy Navel. Donâ€™t be turned off by the bizarre name, which is admittedly not the most appetizing. Before your mind wanders to grooming habits, the explanation is quite simple: Fuzzy refers to the peach schnapps (think peach fuzz) and the navel refers to the type of orange.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

         <ul>
            <li>3 ounces peach schnapps</li>
            <li>3 ounces orange juice, freshly squeezed
            <li>Garnish: 1 orange slice</li>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the peach schnapps and orange juice into a highball glass over ice, and stir briefly to combine.</li>
            <li>Garnish with an orange slice.</li>
        </ol>
