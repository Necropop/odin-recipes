        <p>The Moscow Mule is a classic combination of vodka, ginger beer, and lime. Known for it's iconic copper mug, the drink's enduring popularity has left it as a mainstay in bars since the mid-20th century. Despite its name, the Moscow Mule was actually invented in Los Angeles as part of an early stateside marketing push for vodka, and the drink itself is considered an example of the Buck family of drinksâ€”those that include a spirit with citrus and ginger beer.</p>
